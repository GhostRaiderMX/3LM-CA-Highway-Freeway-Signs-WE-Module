## Requirements

### Fonts

No fonts included. Any True-Type font (.ttf) can be used with these signs. I personally use Google's Overpass Medium font!

### How to install fonts

1. Download the True-Type font (.ttf) that you want from the Internet.
2. Go to your local Cities: Skylines II mods folder where Write Everywhere is located:
3. %userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Colossal Order\\Cities Skylines II\\ModsData\\.Klyte45Mods\\WriteEverywhere\\fonts (if the fonts folder does not exist, create it manually)
4. Place the True-Type font (.ttf) files inside the folder.
5. Start Cities: Skylines II and load your city.
6. Press the W Icon (Write Everywhere Icon) on the Top Left of your screen. Go to **City Fonts**.
7. Press the **+** button and choose the True-Type font (.ttf).
